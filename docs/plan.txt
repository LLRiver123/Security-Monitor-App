The project will have 3 main parts:
- Agent: Interact with normal monitoring tool to generate response. Will intergrate with ml model later
- UI: Normal UI work with REST API to seperate Agent and UI. Might aswell use ELECTRON
- ML: Will include notesbook for testing, models, data logic....

Plan:
- W1-2: Work with the agent and try to develop a simple UI
- W3-4: Upgrade UI and fix buf agent
- W5-7: Try fine tune or train model and then integrate it into the app logic
- Then...: Fix bug and deploy
